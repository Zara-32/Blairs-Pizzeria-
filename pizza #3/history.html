                <h3>Our Roots</h3>
                <p>The Blair family is proud of its Scottish heritage, but our pizzeria's heart lies in Italy, thanks to the inspiration of Grandma Blair. Born in Milan, Italy, she moved to the United States at the young age of 14 in 1954.</p>

                <h3>Grandma Blairâ€™s Influence</h3>
                <p>Grandma Blair was a culinary explorer, creating dishes that combined traditional Italian flavors with a touch of American innovation. Many of the recipes on our menu come directly from her kitchen. From her home in Milan to her travels across the United States, she perfected every dish, ensuring each bite tells a story of love, family, and tradition.</p>
